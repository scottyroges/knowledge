# QuickSort
Description: uses divide and conquer. Chooses a pivot point and partitions the collection around the pivot so that the left partition is all elements less than the pivot and the right partition is all elements greater than the partition.

Best: O(nlogn)\
Average: O(nlogn)\
Worst: O(n^2)\
Space Complexity: O(logn) - O(1) for the actual partitioning, and O(logn) for the recurision

One of the more commonly used sorting algorithms.
