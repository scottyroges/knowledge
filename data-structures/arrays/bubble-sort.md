# Bubble Sort

Description: Bubble up larger numbers to the end of the array by swapping left to right until there are no swaps needed

Worst Case: O(n^2) - reversed sort order\
Best Case: O(n) - already sorted\
Space Complexity: O(1)

Not the most efficient in most cases, but useful for mostly sorted arrays. Also used only one additional int for extra space to hold the temp variable and does the sorting in place.
